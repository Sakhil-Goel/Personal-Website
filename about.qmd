Hello, my name is Sakhil Goel. I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Toronto, working towards a degree in Statistics, Economics, and Computer Science.

I am very passionate about software development, with a focus on data analysis. Throughout the years I have gained experience in creating software projects and research papers both independently and as part of a team.

I am proficient developing algorithms and data structures in many different programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, where I apply analytical thinking to solve complex problems. Alongside my technical proficiency, I possess a deep understanding of different statistical methods and economic principles.
